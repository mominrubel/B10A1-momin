    <h1>What Is Coding and What Is It Used For?</h1>
    <p>Coding allows humans to communicate with these devices. Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators,
    smart TVs, and cars use internal coding systems. Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as
    a translator. Code converts human input into numerical sequences that computers understand.</p>
    <p>Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to
        complete specific actions. Computer coding functions much like a manual.
        A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a visual or
        to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run
        a successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of text, changing font styles, and opening
        emails all require instructions included in the coded manual.

        Users interact with websites and apps with the help of these coded instructions. The code itself does not show
        up on the screen. Instead, people see the words and images a developer or programmer asks the computer to
        display.</p>
